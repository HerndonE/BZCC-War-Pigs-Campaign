# BZCC-War-Pigs-Campaign

This a is an unofficial story expansion to Battlezone II Combat Commander. The Battlezone 
community has teamed up to help shed light on unexplained questions in the main campaign.

The overall story is ...    
As the war between the ISDF (International Space Defense Force) and Scion's rages on, Braddock needs to 
get the upper hand in this new interstellar warfare. He formed and built a specialized, off the books 'Elite DeathSquad' known as 
War Pigs. Highly trained, ruthless, and unforgiving operatives assigned to cripple the Scion's network. Anything from convoys, 
research facilities, and controlled scrap fields, you name it they hit it. They were authorized to use any means necessary to
make their assigned missions swift and silent. War Pigs collected new technologies such as upgrading production buildings, units 
that can heal from the air, modified Gun Towers and specialized units specially equipped for any high stakes missions and more!

Braddock was unable to keep the secret under wraps. The DeathSquad soon folded when Kossieh showed up because almost everything 
is unknown to the AAN (Alliance of Awakened Nations). The known operatives John Cooke found old Black Dogs communications device 
on planet Bane, Commander Shabayev found out who the Scion's really are, and Major Manson, at his wits end, along with Blue Squad 
is left out to dry. This leaves the ISDF and the AAN with an unstable relationship as Braddock went AWOL. Braddock as we know had 
a personal agenda to keep Project Pedigree silent and to see that Burns would not make it out of the Mire system alive!

This campaign will give players the behind the scenes action of Battlezone Combat Commander throught the War Pigs campaign.

The current mod for this is on the [Battlezone Combat Commander Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1647394926). Once the campaign is finished, this will be an addon to 
the main mod. Enjoy!
